2. Copy demo splash you like to your project in to demo_collection folder.

(Note: If you copy to another folder, just fix the "Load failed due to missing dependencies" error by clicking "Fix Dependencies" and selecting your path.)

## QA:
### How to set main screen is AwesomeSplash.
In Godot engine: Select Project > Project Settings... > Application -> Run -> Main Scene: Select to your Screen Splash screen

### How to hide the default splash screen of Godot engine.
In Godot engine: Select Project > Project Settings... > Application -> Boot Splash -> Image: select (res://addons/awesome_splash/assets/None.png)

### I got an error message "Load failed due to missing dependencies": 
Please put the correct "demo folder" in the path **src/demo_collection/**

(Note: If you copy to another folder, just fix the "Load failed due to missing dependencies" error by clicking "Fix Dependencies" and selecting your path.)

### I got the sprite_language.cpp error message when I installed the plugin:
```core/script_language.cpp:232 - Condition "!global_classes.has(p_class)" is true. Returned: String()```
You may get this error when first time install plugin.
I don't know why - I didn't get this error in the old version, but you can close and reopen the project to fix error :(.

### I don't want to put the code at "src/demo_collection/":
Yes, after successful first run you can change it, godot will automatically fix the import for you. So after successful run you can change the directory of the code.

### I want to change the logo, title, and description in the template.

![splash](https://github.com/duongvituan/godot-awesome-splash/blob/master/image_readme/splash.png)

Yes, you can change background color, animation time, logo, title... via inspector (at - 3 or 5 in above image)


### I want to the user that can skip this splash when they tap on the screen.

![splash](https://github.com/duongvituan/godot-awesome-splash/blob/master/image_readme/container_splash.png)

Yes, you can set it at 6 in above image

### I want to run on mobile (android, ios.. ), what do I need to do?
You don't need to do anything, the splash screen will automatically adjust for you.
